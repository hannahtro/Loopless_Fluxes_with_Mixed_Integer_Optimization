The extension for reversible processes, as done by Haldane, makes it even more relevant as most enzymes catalyze reactions that are reversible in nature and carry in vivo flux in both directions. Here, we decompose the reversible Michaelis–Menten equation into three terms, each with a clear physical meaning: catalytic capacity, substrate saturation and thermodynamic driving force. This decomposition facilitates a better understanding of enzyme kinetics and highlights the relationship between thermodynamics and kinetics, a relationship which is often neglected. We further demonstrate how our separable rate law can be understood from different points of view, shedding light on factors shaping enzyme catalysis.},

	abstract = {Metabolic models are typically characterized by a large number of parameters. Traditionally, metabolic control analysis is applied to differential equation-based models to investigate the sensitivity of predictions to parameters. A corresponding theory for constraint-based models is lacking, due to their formulation as optimization problems. Here, we show that optimal solutions of optimization problems can be efficiently differentiated using constrained optimization duality and implicit differentiation. We use this to calculate the sensitivities of predicted reaction fluxes and enzyme concentrations to turnover numbers in an enzyme-constrained metabolic model of Escherichia coli. The sensitivities quantitatively identify rate limiting enzymes and are mathematically precise, unlike current finite difference based approaches used for sensitivity analysis. Further, efficient differentiation of constraint-based models unlocks the ability to use gradient information for parameter estimation. We demonstrate this by improving, genome-wide, the state-of-the-art turnover number estimates for E. coli. Finally, we show that this technique can be generalized to arbitrarily complex models. By differentiating the optimal solution of a model incorporating both thermodynamic and kinetic rate equations, the effect of metabolite concentrations on biomass growth can be elucidated. We benchmark these metabolite sensitivities against a large experimental gene knockdown study, and find good alignment between the predicted sensitivities and in vivo metabolome changes. In sum, we demonstrate several applications of differentiating optimal solutions of constraint-based metabolic models, and show how it connects to classic metabolic control analysis.},

The species composition and overall function of microbial communities are largely shaped by metabolic interactions such as competition for resources and cross-feeding. Although considerable scientific progress has been made towards mapping and modelling species-level metabolism, elucidating the metabolic exchanges between microorganisms and steering the community dynamics remain an enormous scientific challenge. In view of the complexity, computational models of microbial communities are essential to obtain systems-level understanding of ecosystem functioning. This review discusses the applications and limitations of constraint-based stoichiometric modelling tools, and in particular flux balance analysis ({FBA}). We explain this approach from first principles and identify the challenges one faces when extending it to communities, and discuss the approaches used in the field in view of these challenges. We distinguish between steady-state and dynamic {FBA} approaches extended to communities. We conclude that much progress has been made, but many of the challenges are still open.},

They rely on defining a set of constraints, the most common of which is that the production of metabolites and/or growth are limited by the carbon source uptake rate. However, enzyme abundances and kinetics, which act as limitations on metabolic fluxes, are not taken into account. Here, we present {GECKO}, a method that enhances a {GEM} to account for enzymes as part of reactions, thereby ensuring that each metabolic flux does not exceed its maximum capacity, equal to the product of the enzyme's abundance and turnover number. We applied {GECKO} to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae {GEM} and demonstrated that the new model could correctly describe phenotypes that the previous model could not, particularly under high enzymatic pressure conditions, such as yeast growing on different carbon sources in excess, coping with stress, or overexpressing a specific pathway. {GECKO} also allows to directly integrate quantitative proteomics data; by doing so, we significantly reduced flux variability of the model, in over 60\% of metabolic reactions. Additionally, the model gives insight into the distribution of enzyme usage between and within metabolic pathways. The developed method and model are expected to increase the use of model-based design in metabolic engineering.},

	abstract = {The constraint-based reconstruction and analysis ({COBRA}) framework has been widely used to study steady-state flux solutions in genome-scale metabolic networks. One shortcoming of current {COBRA} methods is the possible violation of the loop law in the computed steady-state flux solutions. The loop law is analogous to Kirchhoff's second law for electric circuits, and states that at steady state there can be no net flux around a closed network cycle. Although the consequences of the loop law have been known for years, it has been computationally difficult to work with. Therefore, the resulting loop-law constraints have been overlooked. Here, we present a general mixed integer programming approach called loopless {COBRA} (ll-{COBRA}), which can be used to eliminate all steady-state flux solutions that are incompatible with the loop law. We apply this approach to improve flux predictions on three common {COBRA} methods: flux balance analysis, flux variability analysis, and Monte Carlo sampling of the flux space. Moreover, we demonstrate that the imposition of loop-law constraints with ll-{COBRA} improves the consistency of simulation results with experimental data. This method provides an additional constraint for many {COBRA} methods, enabling the acquisition of more realistic simulation results.},

Recently developed solution methods can solve even large-scale {GPs} extremely efﬁciently and reliably; at the same time a number of practical problems, particularly in circuit design, have been found to be equivalent to (or well approximated by) {GPs}. Putting these two together, we get effective solutions for the practical problems. The basic approach in {GP} modeling is to attempt to express a practical problem, such as an engineering analysis or design problem, in {GP} format. In the best case, this formulation is exact; when this is not possible, we settle for an approximate formulation. This tutorial paper collects together in one place the basic background material needed to do {GP} modeling. We start with the basic deﬁnitions and facts, and some methods used to transform problems into {GP} format. We show how to recognize functions and problems compatible with {GP}, and how to approximate functions or data in a form compatible with {GP} (when this is possible). We give some simple and representative examples, and also describe some common extensions of {GP}, along with methods for solving (or approximately solving) them.},

Yet, the application of genome-scale models, especially to microbial communities, is lagging behind the availability of sequenced genomes. This is largely due to the time-consuming steps of manual curation required to obtain good quality models. Here, we present an automated tool, {CarveMe}, for reconstruction of species and community level metabolic models. We introduce the concept of a universal model, which is manually curated and simulation ready. Starting with this universal model and annotated genome sequences, {CarveMe} uses a top-down approach to build single-species and community models in a fast and scalable manner. We show that {CarveMe} models perform closely to manually curated models in reproducing experimental phenotypes (substrate utilization and gene essentiality). Additionally, we build a collection of 74 models for human gut bacteria and test their ability to reproduce growth on a set of experimentally defined media. Finally, we create a database of 5587 bacterial models and demonstrate its potential for fast generation of microbial community models. Overall, {CarveMe} provides an open-source and user-friendly tool towards broadening the use of metabolic modeling in studying microbial species and communities.},

	abstract = {The growth rate-dependent regulation of cell size, ribosomal content, and metabolic efficiency follows a common pattern in unicellular organisms: with increasing growth rates, cell size and ribosomal content increase and a shift to energetically inefficient metabolism takes place. The latter two phenomena are also observed in fast growing tumour cells and cell lines. These patterns suggest a fundamental principle of design. In biology such designs can often be understood as the result of the optimization of fitness. Here we show that in basic models of self-replicating systems these patterns are the consequence of maximizing the growth rate. Whereas most models of cellular growth consider a part of physiology, for instance only metabolism, the approach presented here integrates several subsystems to a complete self-replicating system. Such models can yield fundamentally different optimal strategies. In particular, it is shown how the shift in metabolic efficiency originates from a tradeoff between investments in enzyme synthesis and metabolic yields for alternative catabolic pathways. The models elucidate how the optimization of growth by natural selection shapes growth strategies.},

	abstract = {Identifying the factors that determine microbial growth rate under various environmental and genetic conditions is a major challenge of systems biology. While current genome-scale metabolic modeling approaches enable us to successfully predict a variety of metabolic phenotypes, including maximal biomass yield, the prediction of actual growth rate is a long standing goal. This gap stems from strictly relying on data regarding reaction stoichiometry and directionality, without accounting for enzyme kinetic considerations. Here we present a novel metabolic network-based approach, {MetabOlic} Modeling with {ENzyme} {kineTics} ({MOMENT}), which predicts metabolic flux rate and growth rate by utilizing prior data on enzyme turnover rates and enzyme molecular weights, without requiring measurements of nutrient uptake rates. The method is based on an identified design principle of metabolism in which enzymes catalyzing high flux reactions across different media tend to be more efficient in terms of having higher turnover numbers. Extending upon previous attempts to utilize kinetic data in genome-scale metabolic modeling, our approach takes into account the requirement for specific enzyme concentrations for catalyzing predicted metabolic flux rates, considering isozymes, protein complexes, and multi-functional enzymes. {MOMENT} is shown to significantly improve the prediction accuracy of various metabolic phenotypes in E. coli, including intracellular flux rates and changes in gene expression levels under different growth rates. Most importantly, {MOMENT} is shown to predict growth rates of E. coli under a diverse set of media that are correlated with experimental measurements, markedly improving upon existing state-of-the art stoichiometric modeling approaches. These results support the view that a physiological bound on cellular enzyme concentrations is a key factor that determines microbial growth rate.},

We demonstrate that the model's predictions for the relative maximum growth rate of wild-type and mutant E. coli cells in single substrate-limited media, and the sequence and mode of substrate uptake and utilization from a complex medium are in good agreement with subsequent experimental observations.

	abstract = {Mixed-integer programs ({MIPs}) involving logical implications modeled through big-M coefficients are notoriously among the hardest to solve. In this paper, we propose and analyze computationally an automatic problem reformulation of quite general applicability, aimed at removing the model dependency on the big-M coefficients. Our solution scheme defines a master integer linear problem ({ILP}) with no continuous variables, which contains combinatorial information on the feasible integer variable combinations that can be "distilled" from the original {MIP} model. The master solutions are sent to a slave linear program ({LP}), which validates them and possibly returns combinatorial inequalities to be added to the current master {ILP}. The inequalities are associated to minimal (or irreducible) infeasible subsystems of a certain linear system, and can be separated efficiently in case the master solution is integer. The overall solution mechanism closely resembles the Benders' one, but the cuts we produce are purely combinatorial and do not depend on the big-M values used in the {MIP} formulation. This produces an {LP} relaxation of the master problem which can be considerably tighter than the one associated with original {MIP} formulation.

Flux balance analysis ({FBA}) is based on the constraint of mass conservation; energy balance analysis ({EBA}) is based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The power of these approaches lies in the fact that the constraints are based on physical laws, and do not make use of unknown parameters. Here, we show that the network structure (i.e. the stoichiometric matrix) alone provides a system of constraints on the fluxes in a biochemical network which are feasible according to both mass balance and the laws of thermodynamics. A realistic example shows that these constraints can be sufficient for deriving unambiguous, biologically meaningful results. The thermodynamic constraints are obtained by comparing of the sign pattern of the flux vector to the sign patterns of the cycles of the internal cycle space via connection between stoichiometric network theory ({SNT}) and the mathematical theory of oriented matroids.},

Of the many variants of constrain-based modelling methods published throughout the years, only few have focused on thermodynamic issues, in particular the elimination of non-physical and non-physiological cyclic fluxes. In this work, we revisit two of these methods, namely thermodynamic {FBA} and loopless {FBA}, and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each one. Finally, we suggest a compromise denoted semi-thermodynamic {FBA} (st-{FBA}) which imposes stronger thermodynamic constrains on the flux polytope compared to loopless {FBA}, without requiring a large set of thermodynamic parameters as in the case of thermodynamic {FBA}. We show that st-{FBA} is a useful and simple way to eliminate thermodynamically infeasible cycles that generate {ATP}.},

	abstract = {The influence of metabolism on signaling, epigenetic markers, and transcription is highly complex yet important for understanding cancer physiology. Despite the development of high-resolution multi-omics technologies, it is difficult to infer metabolic activity from these indirect measurements. Fortunately, genome-scale metabolic models and constraint-based modeling provide a systems biology framework to investigate the metabolic states and define the genotype-phenotype associations by integrations of multi-omics data. Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis ({COBRA}) methods are used to build and simulate metabolic networks using mathematical representations of biochemical reactions, gene-protein reaction associations, and physiological and biochemical constraints. These methods have led to advancements in metabolic reconstruction, network analysis, perturbation studies as well as prediction of metabolic state. Most computational tools for performing these analyses are written for {MATLAB}, a proprietary software. In order to increase accessibility and handle more complex datasets and models, community efforts have started to develop similar open-source tools in Python. To date there is a comprehensive set of tools in Python to perform various flux analyses and visualizations; however, there are still missing algorithms in some key areas. This review summarizes the availability of Python software for several components of {COBRA} methods and their applications in cancer metabolism. These tools are evolving rapidly and should offer a readily accessible, versatile way to model the intricacies of cancer metabolism for identifying cancer-specific metabolic features that constitute potential drug targets.},

They rely on defining a set of constraints, the most common of which is that the production of metabolites and/or growth are limited by the carbon source uptake rate. However, enzyme abundances and kinetics, which act as limitations on metabolic fluxes, are not taken into account. Here, we present {GECKO}, a method that enhances a {GEM} to account for enzymes as part of reactions, thereby ensuring that each metabolic flux does not exceed its maximum capacity, equal to the product of the enzyme's abundance and turnover number. We applied {GECKO} to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae {GEM} and demonstrated that the new model could correctly describe phenotypes that the previous model could not, particularly under high enzymatic pressure conditions, such as yeast growing on different carbon sources in excess, coping with stress, or overexpressing a specific pathway. {GECKO} also allows to directly integrate quantitative proteomics data; by doing so, we significantly reduced flux variability of the model, in over 60\% of metabolic reactions. Additionally, the model gives insight into the distribution of enzyme usage between and within metabolic pathways. The developed method and model are expected to increase the use of model-based design in metabolic engineering.},

Given an oracle that provides the distance from a point to S, we construct a pure cutting plane algorithm which is shown to converge if the initial relaxation is a polyhedron. These cuts are generated from convex forbidden zones, or S-free sets, derived from the oracle. We also consider the special case of polynomial optimization. Accordingly we develop a theory of outer-product-free sets, where S is the set of real, symmetric matrices of the form \$\$xx{\textasciicircum}T\$\$. All maximal outer-product-free sets of full dimension are shown to be convex cones and we identify several families of such sets. These families are used to generate strengthened intersection cuts that can separate any infeasible extreme point of a linear programming relaxation efficiently.

	abstract = {Elementary flux modes ({EFMs}) play a prominent role in the constraint-based analysis of metabolic networks. They correspond to minimal functional units of the metabolic network at steady-state and as such have been studied for almost 30 years. The set of all {EFMs} in a metabolic network tends to be very large and may have exponential size in the number of reactions. Hence, there is a need to elucidate the structure of this set. Here we focus on geometric properties of {EFMs}. We analyze the distribution of {EFMs} in the face lattice of the steady-state flux cone of the metabolic network and show that {EFMs} in the relative interior of the cone occur only in very special cases. We introduce the concept of degree of an {EFM} as a measure how elementary it is and study the decomposition of flux vectors and {EFMs} depending on their degree. Geometric analysis can help to better understand the structure of the set of {EFMs}, which is important from both the mathematical and the biological viewpoint.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new class of cutting planes for integer programming. A typical member of the class is generated as follows. Let X be the feasible set, and x̄ the optimal (noninteger) solution to the linear program associated with an integer program in n-space. Consider a unit hypercube containing x̄, whose vertices are integer, and the hypersphere circumscribing the cube. This hypersphere is intersected in n independent points by the n halflines originating at x̄ and containing the n edges of X adjacent to x̄ (if x̄ is degenerate, X is replaced by \$X{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime\}{\textbackslash}supset X\$ having exactly n edges adjacent to x̄). The hyperplane through these n points of intersection defines a valid cut, the (spherical) intersection cut. The paper gives a simple formula for finding the equation of the hyperplane, discusses some ways of strengthening the cut, proposes an algorithm, and gives a finiteness proof. A straightforward extension of these geometric ideas yields an analogous (cylindrical) intersection cut for the mixed-integer case. A discussion of relations to other work (Young, Gomory) is followed by the introduction of some additional intersection cuts obtained from hypersurfaces other than the sphere or the cylinder. The message of this paper lies, not so much in the particular cuts that it proposes, as in the basically new approach to integer programming that these cuts typify. This approach is geometrically motivated and uses the 'local' properties (in the integer-programming sense) of the feasible set.},

	abstract = {Cutting plane selection is a subroutine used in all modern mixed-integer linear programming solvers with the goal of selecting a subset of generated cuts that induce optimal solver performance. These solvers have millions of parameter combinations, and so are excellent candidates for parameter tuning. Cut selection scoring rules are usually weighted sums of different measurements, where the weights are parameters. We present a parametric family of mixed-integer linear programs together with infinitely many family-wide valid cuts. Some of these cuts can induce integer optimal solutions directly after being applied, while others fail to do so even if an infinite amount are applied. We show for a specific cut selection rule, that any finite grid search of the parameter space will always miss all parameter values, which select integer optimal inducing cuts in an infinite amount of our problems. We propose a variation on the design of existing graph convolutional neural networks, adapting them to learn cut selection rule parameters. We present a reinforcement learning framework for selecting cuts, and train our design using said framework over {MIPLIB} 2017 and a neural network verification data set. Our framework and design show that adaptive cut selection does substantially improve performance over a diverse set of instances, but that finding a single function describing such a rule is difficult.
