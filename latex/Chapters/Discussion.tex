In this section we present the results of the computational experiments. The performance of solving the big-M reformulation of \textsf{ll-FBA} directly with \textsf{SCIP} is shown in \cref{section:methods_ll_fba_variants}. We experiment with blocking cycles (\cref{section:results_blocking_cycles}), decomposing the ll-FBA problem (\cref{section:results_cuts}) and the convex-hull formulation (\cref{section:results_dp}).

\subsection{ll-FBA Variants} \label{section:methods_ll_fba_variants}
First, we look at the performance of solving the different ll-FBA variants by \textsf{SCIP} directly. We compare the running time and number of solved BiGG instances of \textsf{ll-FBA (indicator)}, of \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} and of \textsf{ll-FBA (nullspace)} (see \cref{section:llfba_variants}).\\
The results are shown in \cref{fig:ll_fba_comparison}.
With \textsf{SCIP}, we solve around $60\%$ of the instances using \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)}, whereas around $30\%$ of the instances using \textsf{ll-FBA (nullspace)} are solved. With \textsf{ll-FBA (indicator)} we solve around $30\%$ of the instances. \textsf{iSB619} is infeasible for \textsf{ll-FBA (indicator)} and are therefore excluded from the experiments with indicator constraints. \todo[inline]{update}

\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
As we solve twice as many instances with \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} compared to \textsf{ll-FBA (nullspace)}, we use \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} for the other experiments. Even though with \textsf{ll-FBA (indicator)} we also solve fewer instances than with \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)}, we use it for some of the experiments. Due to the explicit indicator constraints, the solving procedure is different compared to a mixed-integer linear program. With indicator constraints, less instances are solved, but some instances are solved much faster. For example, the ll-FBA problems of organisms \textsf{iMM1415} and \textsf{iJN746} with indicator constraints are solved in 71 and 10 seconds, whereas with the big-M formulation we need 1550 and 332 seconds (see \cref{tab:ll_fba_comparison}). \todo[inline]{justify why instances are highlighted}

\newpage
\subsection{Blocking Cycles in FBA} \label{section:results_blocking_cycles}
We experiment with blocking cycles in \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} as explained in \cref{section:blocking_cycles} on a subset of BiGG instances.
We then compare solving \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} directly to 8 different setups. We block any 10, 20, 50 and 100 cycles, and the 10, 20, 50 and 100 shortest cycles found prior to solving \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)}. 
We solve each setup with five different \textsf{SCIP} seeds for each organism and set the time limit to 1800 minutes. The results are shown in \cref{fig:cff_comparison}.\\
We see that the running time for the organisms \textsf{e\_coli\_core}, \textsf{iCN900}, \textsf{iAF692} and \textsf{iJR904} is only a few seconds and we see no impact of the different \textsf{SCIP} seeds. Organism \textsf{iML1515} cannot be solved within the given time limit by any solving strategy. For the other instances, we observe a small instance variability for \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} which shows that the difficulty is consistent across seeds which does not depend on the performance variability of \textsf{SCIP}. The performance of the different solving strategies varies strongly. 
The instance variability of the setups differs significantly. Often, we see hardly any variability, while the running time for others varies upto 10 minutes, for example \textsf{ll-FBA blocked 50} and \textsf{ll-FBA blocked 100} on \textsf{iSFV\_1184}, and for \textsf{ll-FBA shortest blocked 20} and \textsf{ll-FBA shortest blocked 100} on \textsf{iMM904}. Some instances are solved faster by a blocking cycle strategy than solving \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} directly. However, the performance varies for different instances and seeds, and several strategies take much more time and some cannot solve within the time limit.\\
\cref{fig:cff_comparison} is not sufficient to conclude which setup outperforms the other. For such a statement we would require additional tests on more models. 
We also have to consider the time spent in the cycle search, which is not included in the figure (see \cref{tab:cff_time}).
However, the results show that with cuts we can potentially improve the performance compared to solving \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} directly, which is tested in detail in the next section.

\subsection{Decomposition} \label{section:results_cuts}
\todo[inline]{rename and reformulate; reformulation of the problem instead of valid inequalities}
Instead of solving the \textsf{ll-FBA} problem directly, we decompose the problem into a master problem, which is the relaxed \textsf{ll-FBA} problem, and add a cut if a solution to the relaxed problem does not satisfy the thermodynamic constraints.\\
% \subsection{No-Good Cuts}
We first compare solving \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} directly to solving the decomposition of \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} with no-good cuts (see \cref{section:no_good_cuts}). While we are able to solve around $60\%$ by passing \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} directly to \textsf{SCIP}, we solve only $8\%$ with no-good cuts. The \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} problem of organism \textsf{iAF692} is said to be infeasible with the no-good cut method. If we solve the instance with a higher precision, the instance cannot be solved within the time limit. \cref{fig:no_good_cuts_comparison_plot} shows the running time and the number of solved instances.
As with no-good cuts, we only block one assignment of binary variables $\bold a$ per iteration, it requires many cuts to obtain a loopless solution.

% \subsection{Combinatorial Benders' Cuts}
\newpage
Next, we look at the comparison of the ll-FBA variants with the combinatorial Benders' approach. We experiment with three different formulations of the master problem (\cref{problem:noGoodCut}) and add one cut per iteration of \cref{alg:CB}. We use:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the indicator formulation, 
    \item the big-M reformulation, 
    \item the indicator formulation and big-M reformulation.
\end{enumerate}

We experiment with different formulations of the master problem: big-M reformulation, indicator constraints, and indicator and big-M constraints. Per iteration of the combinatorial Benders' approach, one minimal infeasible subsystem is computed.}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:comparison_solved_instances_indicator_and_big_m_as_MP} shows the running time and the number of solved BiGG instances by the three combinatorial Benders' setups and by solving \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} and \textsf{ll-FBA (indicator)} with \textsf{SCIP} directly within a time limit of 1800 seconds. 
With the combinatorial Benders' approach we are able to solve many more instances than by solving both ll-FBA variants directly. Combinatorial Benders' cuts are much stronger than no-good cuts. Instead of blocking the entire direction of binary variables $\bold a$ in the problem, we block one cycle per iteration. \\
Solving \textsf{ll-FBA (indicator)} directly leads to 27\% optimally solved instances, whereas with combinatorial Benders' with indicator constraints (\textsf{CB (indicator)}) we solve 84\% of the instances to optimality. Solving \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} directly leads to 59\% optimally solved instances, whereas with combinatorial Benders' with big-M constraints (\textsf{CB (big-M)}) we solve 89\% of the instances to optimality. %However, \cref{Tab:termination_CB_indicator} and \cref{Tab:termination_CB_big_m} show that for each combinatorial Benders' setup, some instances cannot be solved even though the time limit is not hit. 
However, \cref{Tab:termination_CB_big_m} shows that for the combinatorial Benders' decomposition of \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)}, one instance is said to be infeasible, even though solving \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} returns an optimal solution. If we solve the instance with a tighter tolerance, we find an optimal solution in 264 seconds, whereas solving the \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} of \textsf{iRC1080} directly takes 373 seconds.

\todo[inline]{merge tables ?}

So far, we added one combinatorial Benders' cut per iteration of \cref{alg:CB}. In \cref{fig:mis_comparison_solved_instances} we compare the performance of solving \textsf{ll-FBA (indicator)} directly with solving it with the combinatorial Benders' method by experimenting with the number of cuts added per iteration (see \cref{section:cb}). As expected, using more cuts than one per iteration, reduces the running time. Any combinatorial Benders' setup with multiple cuts per iteration solves faster than adding a single cut per iteration. For most setups, we see that more cuts lead to fewer iterations. However, too many cuts per iteration can lead to more iterations and a worse overall running time. For example, when blocking up to 20\% of the number of reactions in the organism per iteration, the number of iterations increases for some instances and the overall performance is reduced. %\todo[inline]{\% here misleading}

In \cref{fig:mis_comparison_time_vs_iterations}, we see that with several cuts per iteration, the number of iterations is reduced while the time spent in the MIS search is larger. The average time spent in solving the master problem is smaller but overall much less than the time spent in the MIS search.

Next, we compare solving \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} directly to solving it with the combinatorial Benders' approach (see \cref{section:cb}) by experimenting with the number of cuts added per iteration. With one cut per iteration we already solve 92\% of the BiGG instances to optimality and are faster than the combinatorial Benders' decomposition with indicator constraints. As with indicator constraints, with big-M constraints adding multiple cuts per iteration can speed up the solution process. However, adding MIS 2\% or more cuts per iteration perform much worse than combinatorial Benders' with one cut per iteration and fewer iterations are solved within the time limit. With 0.5\% MIS we see the best performance overall, and require the least number of iterations per instance.

% \todo[inline]{add less cuts}

In \cref{{Tab:termination_mis_big_m}} we see that with MIS 5.0\% or more, we solve much fewer instances due to hitting the time limit and due to errors during the solution process. With a good choice of allowed cuts per iteration we outperform combinatorial Benders' with indicator constraints. However, combinatorial Benders' with big-M constraints is less robust: the solution process errors more often and the choice of allowed cuts per iteration can increase the running time significantly.

The comparison of the fraction of average time spent in the MIS search and in the master problem with big-M constraints in relation to the total number of iterations is less structured than the comparison with the indicator setting. Overall, the time spent in the MIS search and in solving the master problem is larger with more cuts, however fewer iterations are to solve.

After experimenting with several formulations of the master problem and with the number of cuts per iteration of \cref{alg:CB}, we test both solving strategies on the yeast models (see \cref{section:methods_yeast}), which are larger than most BiGG models tested. In \cref{Tab:yeast}, we see that neither solving strategies performs well on the yeast instances. Only with one strategy we solve 1 out of 11 instances. In comparison to the BiGG models tested, combinatorial Benders with big-M constraints is more robust. Combinatorial Benders with indicator constraints leads to more errors in the solution process.

We compare solving \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} directly to solving it with the combinatorial Benders' decomposition, as the big-M formulation showed the best performance on the other experiments. We compare blocking one cycle per iteration to blocking 0.5\%. The results are shown in \cref{fig:comparison_gecko}.
We see that both combinatorial Benders' variants solve similarly and outperform solving \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} directly. Both combinatorial Benders' variants require few iterations, and solve after one iteration for almost all instances. As the reaction rate is limited by enzyme abundance, the solution to the relaxed problem contains already fewer loops. Therefore, less cuts are needed to obtain an optimal solution.

\end{figure}

However, looking at \cref{Tab:gecko}, we see that the combinatorial Benders' approach is not robust. We solve 77\% of instances to optimality, but terminate the solution process in 18\% of the instances not due to time limit but due to errors in the solving process.

In our case, we are able to solve most enzyme instances within a few seconds. As the enzyme data is randomly generated, we do not make a claim on the performance on enzyme models in general. However, this shows the flexibility of the combinatorial Benders' approach, which can be extended by linear constraints easily.

% \subsection{Intersection Cuts}
\subsection{Disjunctive Programming} \label{section:results_dp}
We have seen that with cuts it is possible to reduce the running time of solving \textsf{ll-FBA (indicator)} and \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)}. Now we return to the disjunctive programming formulation of our problem. We use the \textsf{DisjunctiveProgramming} package to get the hull formulation and the big-M reformulation. We compare the performance of solving \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} directly, solving the big-M reformulation of the disjunctive program with optimizing the choice of $M$, the hull formulation of the disjunctive program and solving \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} with combinatorial Benders' cuts within a time limit of 1800 seconds. The difference between our big-M formulation is that in the package the choice of $M$ is optimized. \\
\cref{fig:dp} shows that we solve the least instances with the convex-hull formulation.  
Even though, the feasible region of the hull reformulation is the convex hull, the reformulation requires more constraints and decision variables, which leads to an increased running time. With the big-M reformulation of the \textsf{DisjunctiveProgramming} package, we solve more instances than with our big-M formulation. The $M$ constant determines how large the approximation of the feasible region is. Choosing the smallest $M$ possible, we obtain a tighter approximation and more instances can be solved within the time limit. When we compare solving the MIP reformulations to solving \textsf{ll-FBA (big-M)} with combinatorial Benders' cuts, we see that with the latter we are able to solve most of the instances and are significantly faster.

We add one cut per iteration of the combinatorial Benders' approach.}
