The extension for reversible processes, as done by Haldane, makes it even more relevant as most enzymes catalyze reactions that are reversible in nature and carry in vivo flux in both directions. Here, we decompose the reversible Michaelis–Menten equation into three terms, each with a clear physical meaning: catalytic capacity, substrate saturation and thermodynamic driving force. This decomposition facilitates a better understanding of enzyme kinetics and highlights the relationship between thermodynamics and kinetics, a relationship which is often neglected. We further demonstrate how our separable rate law can be understood from different points of view, shedding light on factors shaping enzyme catalysis.},

	abstract = {Metabolic models are typically characterized by a large number of parameters. Traditionally, metabolic control analysis is applied to differential equation-based models to investigate the sensitivity of predictions to parameters. A corresponding theory for constraint-based models is lacking, due to their formulation as optimization problems. Here, we show that optimal solutions of optimization problems can be efficiently differentiated using constrained optimization duality and implicit differentiation. We use this to calculate the sensitivities of predicted reaction fluxes and enzyme concentrations to turnover numbers in an enzyme-constrained metabolic model of Escherichia coli. The sensitivities quantitatively identify rate limiting enzymes and are mathematically precise, unlike current finite difference based approaches used for sensitivity analysis. Further, efficient differentiation of constraint-based models unlocks the ability to use gradient information for parameter estimation. We demonstrate this by improving, genome-wide, the state-of-the-art turnover number estimates for E. coli. Finally, we show that this technique can be generalized to arbitrarily complex models. By differentiating the optimal solution of a model incorporating both thermodynamic and kinetic rate equations, the effect of metabolite concentrations on biomass growth can be elucidated. We benchmark these metabolite sensitivities against a large experimental gene knockdown study, and find good alignment between the predicted sensitivities and in vivo metabolome changes. In sum, we demonstrate several applications of differentiating optimal solutions of constraint-based metabolic models, and show how it connects to classic metabolic control analysis.},

The species composition and overall function of microbial communities are largely shaped by metabolic interactions such as competition for resources and cross-feeding. Although considerable scientific progress has been made towards mapping and modelling species-level metabolism, elucidating the metabolic exchanges between microorganisms and steering the community dynamics remain an enormous scientific challenge. In view of the complexity, computational models of microbial communities are essential to obtain systems-level understanding of ecosystem functioning. This review discusses the applications and limitations of constraint-based stoichiometric modelling tools, and in particular flux balance analysis ({FBA}). We explain this approach from first principles and identify the challenges one faces when extending it to communities, and discuss the approaches used in the field in view of these challenges. We distinguish between steady-state and dynamic {FBA} approaches extended to communities. We conclude that much progress has been made, but many of the challenges are still open.},

Here, we present {GECKO}, a method that enhances a {GEM} to account for enzymes as part of reactions, thereby ensuring that each metabolic flux does not exceed its maximum capacity, equal to the product of the enzyme's abundance and turnover number. We applied {GECKO} to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae {GEM} and demonstrated that the new model could correctly describe phenotypes that the previous model could not, particularly under high enzymatic pressure conditions, such as yeast growing on different carbon sources in excess, coping with stress, or overexpressing a specific pathway. {GECKO} also allows to directly integrate quantitative proteomics data; by doing so, we significantly reduced flux variability of the model, in over 60\% of metabolic reactions. Additionally, the model gives insight into the distribution of enzyme usage between and within metabolic pathways. The developed method and model are expected to increase the use of model-based design in metabolic engineering.},

One shortcoming of current {COBRA} methods is the possible violation of the loop law in the computed steady-state flux solutions. The loop law is analogous to Kirchhoff's second law for electric circuits, and states that at steady state there can be no net flux around a closed network cycle. Although the consequences of the loop law have been known for years, it has been computationally difficult to work with. Therefore, the resulting loop-law constraints have been overlooked. Here, we present a general mixed integer programming approach called loopless {COBRA} (ll-{COBRA}), which can be used to eliminate all steady-state flux solutions that are incompatible with the loop law. We apply this approach to improve flux predictions on three common {COBRA} methods: flux balance analysis, flux variability analysis, and Monte Carlo sampling of the flux space. Moreover, we demonstrate that the imposition of loop-law constraints with ll-{COBRA} improves the consistency of simulation results with experimental data. This method provides an additional constraint for many {COBRA} methods, enabling the acquisition of more realistic simulation results.},

Yet, the application of genome-scale models, especially to microbial communities, is lagging behind the availability of sequenced genomes. This is largely due to the time-consuming steps of manual curation required to obtain good quality models. Here, we present an automated tool, {CarveMe}, for reconstruction of species and community level metabolic models. We introduce the concept of a universal model, which is manually curated and simulation ready. Starting with this universal model and annotated genome sequences, {CarveMe} uses a top-down approach to build single-species and community models in a fast and scalable manner. We show that {CarveMe} models perform closely to manually curated models in reproducing experimental phenotypes (substrate utilization and gene essentiality). Additionally, we build a collection of 74 models for human gut bacteria and test their ability to reproduce growth on a set of experimentally defined media. Finally, we create a database of 5587 bacterial models and demonstrate its potential for fast generation of microbial community models. Overall, {CarveMe} provides an open-source and user-friendly tool towards broadening the use of metabolic modeling in studying microbial species and communities.},

Recently developed solution methods can solve even large-scale {GPs} extremely efﬁciently and reliably; at the same time a number of practical problems, particularly in circuit design, have been found to be equivalent to (or well approximated by) {GPs}. Putting these two together, we get effective solutions for the practical problems. The basic approach in {GP} modeling is to attempt to express a practical problem, such as an engineering analysis or design problem, in {GP} format. In the best case, this formulation is exact; when this is not possible, we settle for an approximate formulation. This tutorial paper collects together in one place the basic background material needed to do {GP} modeling. We start with the basic deﬁnitions and facts, and some methods used to transform problems into {GP} format. We show how to recognize functions and problems compatible with {GP}, and how to approximate functions or data in a form compatible with {GP} (when this is possible).

	abstract = {The growth rate-dependent regulation of cell size, ribosomal content, and metabolic efficiency follows a common pattern in unicellular organisms: with increasing growth rates, cell size and ribosomal content increase and a shift to energetically inefficient metabolism takes place. The latter two phenomena are also observed in fast growing tumour cells and cell lines. These patterns suggest a fundamental principle of design. In biology such designs can often be understood as the result of the optimization of fitness. Here we show that in basic models of self-replicating systems these patterns are the consequence of maximizing the growth rate. Whereas most models of cellular growth consider a part of physiology, for instance only metabolism, the approach presented here integrates several subsystems to a complete self-replicating system. Such models can yield fundamentally different optimal strategies. In particular, it is shown how the shift in metabolic efficiency originates from a tradeoff between investments in enzyme synthesis and metabolic yields for alternative catabolic pathways. The models elucidate how the optimization of growth by natural selection shapes growth strategies.},

	abstract = {Background: In order to improve the accuracy of constraint-based metabolic models, several approaches have been developed which intend to integrate additional biological information. Two of these methods, {MOMENT} and {GECKO}, incorporate enzymatic (kcat) parameters and enzyme mass constraints to further constrain the space of feasible metabolic flux distributions. While both methods have been proven to deliver useful extensions of metabolic models, they may considerably increase size and complexity of the models and there is currently no tool available to fully automate generation and calibration of such enzyme-constrained models from given stoichiometric models.
Results: In this work we present three major developments. We first conceived short {MOMENT} ({sMOMENT}), a simplified version of the {MOMENT} approach, which yields the same predictions as {MOMENT} but requires significantly fewer variables and enables direct inclusion of the relevant enzyme constraints in the standard representation of a constraint-based model. When measurements of enzyme concentrations are available, these can be included as well leading in the extreme case, where all enzyme concentrations are known, to a model representation that is analogous to the {GECKO} approach. Second, we developed the {AutoPACMEN} toolbox which allows an almost fully automated creation of {sMOMENT}-enhanced stoichiometric metabolic models. In particular, this includes the automatic read-out and processing of relevant enzymatic data from different databases and the reconfiguration of the stoichiometric model with embedded enzymatic constraints. Additionally, tools have been developed to adjust (kcat and enzyme pool) parameters of {sMOMENT} models based on given flux data. We finally applied the new {sMOMENT} approach and the {AutoPACMEN} toolbox to generate an enzyme-constrained version of the E. coli genome-scale model {iJO}1366 and analyze its key properties and differences with the standard model. In particular, we show that the enzyme constraints improve flux predictions (e.g., explaining overflow metabolism and other metabolic switches) and demonstrate, for the first time, that these constraints can markedly change the spectrum of metabolic engineering strategies for different target products.
Conclusions: The methodological and tool developments presented herein pave the way for a simplified and routine construction and analysis of enzyme-constrained metabolic models.},

	abstract = {Identifying the factors that determine microbial growth rate under various environmental and genetic conditions is a major challenge of systems biology. While current genome-scale metabolic modeling approaches enable us to successfully predict a variety of metabolic phenotypes, including maximal biomass yield, the prediction of actual growth rate is a long standing goal. This gap stems from strictly relying on data regarding reaction stoichiometry and directionality, without accounting for enzyme kinetic considerations. Here we present a novel metabolic network-based approach, {MetabOlic} Modeling with {ENzyme} {kineTics} ({MOMENT}), which predicts metabolic flux rate and growth rate by utilizing prior data on enzyme turnover rates and enzyme molecular weights, without requiring measurements of nutrient uptake rates. The method is based on an identified design principle of metabolism in which enzymes catalyzing high flux reactions across different media tend to be more efficient in terms of having higher turnover numbers. Extending upon previous attempts to utilize kinetic data in genome-scale metabolic modeling, our approach takes into account the requirement for specific enzyme concentrations for catalyzing predicted metabolic flux rates, considering isozymes, protein complexes, and multi-functional enzymes. {MOMENT} is shown to significantly improve the prediction accuracy of various metabolic phenotypes in E. coli, including intracellular flux rates and changes in gene expression levels under different growth rates. Most importantly, {MOMENT} is shown to predict growth rates of E. coli under a diverse set of media that are correlated with experimental measurements, markedly improving upon existing state-of-the art stoichiometric modeling approaches. These results support the view that a physiological bound on cellular enzyme concentrations is a key factor that determines microbial growth rate.},

We demonstrate that the model's predictions for the relative maximum growth rate of wild-type and mutant E. coli cells in single substrate-limited media, and the sequence and mode of substrate uptake and utilization from a complex medium are in good agreement with subsequent experimental observations.

	abstract = {Systems level modelling and simulations of biological processes are proving to be invaluable in obtaining a quantitative and dynamic perspective of various aspects of cellular function. In particular, constraint-based analyses of metabolic networks have gained considerable popularity for simulating cellular metabolism, of which flux balance analysis ({FBA}), is most widely used. Unlike mechanistic simulations that depend on accurate kinetic data, which are scarcely available, {FBA} is based on the principle of conservation of mass in a network, which utilizes the stoichiometric matrix and a biologically relevant objective function to identify optimal reaction flux distributions. {FBA} has been used to analyse genome-scale reconstructions of several organisms; it has also been used to analyse the effect of perturbations, such as gene deletions or drug inhibitions in silico. This article reviews the usefulness of {FBA} as a tool for gaining biological insights, advances in methodology enabling integration of regulatory information and thermodynamic constraints, and finally addresses the challenges that lie ahead. Various use scenarios and biological insights obtained from {FBA}, and applications in fields such metabolic engineering and drug target identification, are also discussed. Genome-scale constraint-based models have an immense potential for building and testing hypotheses, as well as to guide experimentation.},

	abstract = {An important goal of whole-cell computational modeling is to integrate detailed biochemical information with biological intuition to produce testable predictions. Based on the premise that prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli have maximized their growth performance along evolution, flux balance analysis ({FBA}) predicts metabolic flux distributions at steady state by using linear programming. Corroborating earlier results, we show that recent intracellular flux data for wild-type E. coli {JM}101 display excellent agreement with {FBA} predictions. Although the assumption of optimality for a wild-type bacterium is justifiable, the same argument may not be valid for genetically engineered knockouts or other bacterial strains that were not exposed to long-term evolutionary pressure. We address this point by introducing the method of minimization of metabolic adjustment ({MOMA}), whereby we test the hypothesis that knockout metabolic fluxes undergo a minimal redistribution with respect to the flux configuration of the wild type. {MOMA} employs quadratic programming to identify a point in flux space, which is closest to the wild-type point, compatibly with the gene deletion constraint. Comparing {MOMA} and {FBA} predictions to experimental flux data for E. coli pyruvate kinase mutant {PB}25, we find that {MOMA} displays a significantly higher correlation than {FBA}. Our method is further supported by experimental data for E. coli knockout growth rates. It can therefore be used for predicting the behavior of perturbed metabolic networks, whose growth performance is in general suboptimal. {MOMA} and its possible future extensions may be useful in understanding the evolutionary optimization of metabolism.},

However, it is unclear how in silico predictions are related to in vivo epistasis, as {FBA} predicted only a minority of experimentally observed genetic interactions between non-essential metabolic genes in yeast. Here, we perform a detailed comparison of yeast experimental epistasis data to predictions generated with different constraint-based metabolic modeling algorithms. The tested methods comprise standard {FBA}; a variant of {MOMA}, which was specifically designed to predict fitness effects of non-essential gene knockouts; and two alternative implementations of {FBA} with macro-molecular crowding, which account approximately for enzyme kinetics. The number of interactions uniquely predicted by one method is typically larger than its overlap with any alternative method. Only 20\% of negative and 10\% of positive interactions jointly predicted by all methods are confirmed by the experimental data; almost all unique predictions appear to be false. More than two thirds of epistatic interactions are undetectable by any of the tested methods. The low prediction accuracies indicate that the physiology of yeast double metabolic gene knockouts is dominated by processes not captured by current constraint-based analysis methods.},

The set of all possible flux distributions over a metabolic network at steady state defines a polyhedral cone, the steady-state flux cone. Two major approaches exist to characterize this cone: elementary flux modes and extreme pathways. Both use an inner description of the flux cone, which is based on sets of generating vectors. The number of these generators may be very large even for small networks. This limits the practical applicability of these methods. We present a new constraint-based approach to metabolic pathway analysis which uses an outer description of the flux cone, based on sets of non-negativity constraints. These can be identified with irreversible reactions and thus have a direct biochemical interpretation. The resulting description of the flux cone is minimal and unique. Furthermore, it satisfies a simplicity condition similar to the one that holds for elementary flux modes.},

Both parts are coupled through substrate uptake and product secretion rates. This work proposes a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker condition based solution approach for {DFBA} models, which have a nonlinear objective function in the lower-level part. To solve this class of {DFBA} models an extreme-ray-based reformulation is proposed to ensure certain regularity of the lower-level optimization problem.

We introduce here Constrained Allocation Flux Balance Analysis, {CAFBA}, in which the biosynthetic costs associated to growth are accounted for in an effective way through a single additional genome-wide constraint. Its roots lie in the experimentally observed pattern of proteome allocation for metabolic functions, allowing to bridge regulation and metabolism in a transparent way under the principle of growth-rate maximization. We provide a simple method to solve {CAFBA} efficiently and propose an “ensemble averaging” procedure to account for unknown protein costs. Applying this approach to modeling E. coli metabolism, we find that, as the growth rate increases, {CAFBA} solutions cross over from respiratory, growth-yield maximizing states (preferred at slow growth) to fermentative states with carbon overflow (preferred at fast growth). In addition, {CAFBA} allows for quantitatively accurate predictions on the rate of acetate excretion and growth yield based on only 3 parameters determined by empirical growth laws.},

Three cardinal terms are proposed for the quantitative description of enzyme systems. The first two are the control strength and the control matrix; these indicate the dependence of the flux and the metabolite concentrations, respectively, on the kinetic properties of a given enzyme. The third is the effector strength, which defines the dependence of the velocity of an enzyme on the concentration of an effector; it expresses the importance of an effector. By linear approximation simple analytical expressions were derived for the control strength, the control matrix and the mass-action ratios. The effector strength was calculated for two cases: for a competitive inhibitor and for allosteric effectors according to the Monod (1965) model.

In the present paper, we review the foundations of modelling of resource allocation, particularly at the cellular scale: from small macro-molecular models to genome-scale cellular models. We enlighten how the combination of omic measurements and computational advances together with systems biology has contributed to dramatic progresses in the current understanding and prediction of cellular resource allocation. Accurate genome-wide predictive methods of resource allocation based on the resource balance analysis ({RBA}) framework have been developed and ensure a good trade-off between the complexity/tractability and the prediction capability of the model.

	abstract = {Motivation
Flux balance analysis ({FBA}) based bilevel optimization has been a great success in redesigning metabolic networks for biochemical overproduction. To date, many computational approaches have been developed to solve the resulting bilevel optimization problems. However, most of them are of limited use due to biased optimality principle, poor scalability with the size of metabolic networks, potential numeric issues or low quantity of design solutions in a single run.

Results
Here, we have employed a network interdiction model free of growth optimality assumptions, a special case of bilevel optimization, for computational strain design and have developed a hybrid Benders algorithm ({HBA}) that deals with complicating binary variables in the model, thereby achieving high efficiency without numeric issues in search of best design strategies. More importantly, {HBA} can list solutions that meet users’ production requirements during the search, making it possible to obtain numerous design strategies at a small runtime overhead (typically ∼1 h, e.g. studied in this article).

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Constraint-based metabolic modeling methods such as Flux Balance Analysis ({FBA}) are routinely used to predict metabolic phenotypes, e.g. growth rates, {ATP} yield or the fitness of gene knockouts. One frequent difficulty of constraint-based solutions is the inclusion of thermodynamically infeasible loops (or internal cycles), which add nonbiological fluxes to the predictions.
{RESULTS}: We propose a simple postprocessing of constraint-based solutions, which removes internal cycles from any given flux distribution [Formula: see text] without disturbing other fluxes not involved in the loops. This new algorithm, termed {CycleFreeFlux}, works by minimizing the sum of absolute fluxes [Formula: see text] while (i) conserving the exchange fluxes and (ii) using the fluxes of the original solution to bound the new flux distribution. This strategy reduces internal fluxes until at least one reaction of every possible internal cycle is inactive, a necessary and sufficient condition for the thermodynamic feasibility of a flux distribution. If alternative representations of the input flux distribution in terms of elementary flux modes exist that differ in their inclusion of internal cycles, then {CycleFreeFlux} is biased towards solutions that maintain the direction given by [Formula: see text] and towards solutions with lower total flux [Formula: see text]. Our method requires only one additional linear optimization, making it computationally very efficient compared to alternative strategies.
{AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: We provide freely available R implementations for the enumeration of thermodynamically infeasible cycles as well as for cycle-free {FBA} solutions, flux variability calculations and random sampling of solution spaces.

When extended to general convex {MINLPs}, we show that this result yields tight lower bounds compared to classical formulations.

Flux balance analysis ({FBA}) is based on the constraint of mass conservation; energy balance analysis ({EBA}) is based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The power of these approaches lies in the fact that the constraints are based on physical laws, and do not make use of unknown parameters. Here, we show that the network structure (i.e. the stoichiometric matrix) alone provides a system of constraints on the fluxes in a biochemical network which are feasible according to both mass balance and the laws of thermodynamics. A realistic example shows that these constraints can be sufficient for deriving unambiguous, biologically meaningful results. The thermodynamic constraints are obtained by comparing of the sign pattern of the flux vector to the sign patterns of the cycles of the internal cycle space via connection between stoichiometric network theory ({SNT}) and the mathematical theory of oriented matroids.},

In this paper, we propose and analyze computationally an automatic problem reformulation of quite general applicability, aimed at removing the model dependency on the big-M coefficients. Our solution scheme defines a master integer linear problem ({ILP}) with no continuous variables, which contains combinatorial information on the feasible integer variable combinations that can be "distilled" from the original {MIP} model. The master solutions are sent to a slave linear program ({LP}), which validates them and possibly returns combinatorial inequalities to be added to the current master {ILP}. The inequalities are associated to minimal (or irreducible) infeasible subsystems of a certain linear system, and can be separated efficiently in case the master solution is integer. The overall solution mechanism closely resembles the Benders' one, but the cuts we produce are purely combinatorial and do not depend on the big-M values used in the {MIP} formulation. This produces an {LP} relaxation of the master problem which can be considerably tighter than the one associated with original {MIP} formulation. Computational results on two specific classes of hard-to-solve {MIPs} indicate that the new method produces a reformulation which can be solved some orders of magnitude faster than the original {MIP} model.},

	abstract = {The constraint-based approach to analysis of biochemical systems has emerged as a useful tool for rational metabolic engineering. Flux balance analysis ({FBA}) is based on the constraint of mass conservation; energy balance analysis ({EBA}) is based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The power of these approaches lies in the fact that the constraints are based on physical laws, and do not make use of unknown parameters. Here, we show that the network structure (i.e. the stoichiometric matrix) alone provides a system of constraints on the fluxes in a biochemical network which are feasible according to both mass balance and the laws of thermodynamics. A realistic example shows that these constraints can be sufficient for deriving unambiguous, biologically meaningful results. The thermodynamic constraints are obtained by comparing of the sign pattern of the flux vector to the sign patterns of the cycles of the internal cycle space via connection between stoichiometric network theory ({SNT}) and the mathematical theory of oriented matroids.},

After correcting for thermodynamics, the metabolic space scales meaningfully with the physical limiting factors, acquiring in turn a richer multimodal structure potentially leading to symmetry breaking while optimizing for objective functions.},
